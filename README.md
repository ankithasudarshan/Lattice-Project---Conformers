# Lattice-Project---Conformers

In this project, I focused on enhancing contextual recognition in ASR systems using semantic lattice rescoring. During the exploratory phase, we initially aimed to use a conformer model as both a language and acoustic model. While this innovative approach did not materialize as planned, it led to valuable insights and a refined implementation. The project repository now features conformer model implementations specifically tailored for the LJ Speech and TED-LIUM datasets, demonstrating a solid approach to advancing ASR technology.
*This was an experimental portion of my Lattice Rescoing paper.
